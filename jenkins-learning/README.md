# Jenkins Learning

Because Jenkins is written in Java, the default server created by running the Jenkins Docker image has most of the software required to compile and test Java applications.

To build applications written in other languages, you connect external Jenkins agents with the required software and run jobs on those. Using agents is a scalable solution, and one that you should consider if you're using Jenkins in a production environment.
